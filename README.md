**Step 2**: run the setup script

Once you have the project on your local machine, let's install the project dependencies and seed them with example data.

We will run the following command from the root of our project.

``` bash
  yarn setup
```

This will start both our `backend` and `frontend`.

Before navigating to our frontend, you will be prompted to create your first **Strapi Admin** user.

You can check out the `package.json` file for more details on what the script will do.
